# Group Estimator

An app that allows small groups of people (e.g. teams) to estimate things (e.g. storypoints). 

This app is a playground for learning svelte. All the logic is in the front-end; each client uses Stomp to exchange messages with
its peers.

One of the clients is the host and can manage the session. The other clients are participants.
